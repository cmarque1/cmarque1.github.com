Cecilia Márquez is a PhD candidate in the Corcoran Department of History at the University of Virginia where she is completing her dissertation “The Strange Career of Juan Crow: Latino/as, African Americans, and the Making of the US South, 1940-2000.” This project traces the prehistory of the contemporary “Nuevo South” demonstrating that Latinos were shaping ideas about race and region long before the major demographic shifts of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. She is currently completing her dissertation as a 2015-2016 Mellon/ACLS Dissertation Completion Fellow. <br><br>

She has previously held fellowships in Latino Studies at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History and in African American History at the German Historical Institute. Her work has received recognition from the Immigration and Ethnic History Society, winning the George E. Pozzetta Dissertation Award (2014). Additionally, this project has received funding from the Social Science Research Council as well as the Vice President's Office for Research at the University of Virginia.​ <br><br>

Márquez is also engaged in the Digital Humanities after her appointment as a Praxis Fellow in the Digital Humanities at the University of Virginia Scholars Lab. She is particularly interested in the intersection of race and the digital humanities.<br><br>
